26. Aug. /29, August 2016: Implement open loop control for symetric CLT-Converter
!Clearance MosFETs Body
+Regulation
++trise calculation
++tfall calculation
++iterator
+Fixed miscalibration issue: Wait longer by doing 3x the calibration on ADC1.

24. Aug 2016: Power/MCU Tracer Improvements
+UART1 sometimes hung in infinte loop. Added aditional exit condition.
+Added output current esimator
++Works only with symetric waveform
++Works only in non-resonand mode (far aray from frequency)
+Added dead time estimator
++Adjusts deadtime between 5 and 63 cycles according to output current
++Todo: use real current not estimated.

18. Aug 2016: UART Improvements
+Uart1 (mcu_tracer) does not hang up on connect.
++Changes led_lauflicht=2 to indicate communication error.
+UART2 (Si8900) can now establish connection flawless.
!Add to adc 100p Bypass NPO cap, close as possible.
+mcu_tracer reliability improvements.

17. Aug 2016: ADC1 Updates
+Added ADC1 DMA routine, highly flexible
-Remove ADC1 Software readout.
%Wished: ADC0 too
!Work on hardware side to reduce ADC noise.

15. Aug 2016: PWM updates
+PWM Hardware abstraction layer
+PWM Debugging interface over mcu_tracer

12. Aug 2016: Added
+Si8900 manual interface constructed
++Si8900 Sync for autobaudrate detection
++Si8900 readout routine
%Wished: Implement routine with DMA to save processor time.
++Improved routine for Si8900 with DMA implemented..
!!SI8900 is quite slow on readout. Choose alternative?


9. Aug 2016: Added overvoltage protected.
+Filtering added for over voltage protection
+ADC still noisy. Need to work on that.
