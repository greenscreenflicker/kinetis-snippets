17. Aug 2016: ADC1 Updates
+Added ADC1 DMA routine, highly flexible
-Remove ADC1 Software readout.
%Wished: ADC0 too
!Work on hardware side to reduce ADC noise.

15. Aug 2016: PWM updates
+PWM Hardware abstraction layer
+PWM Debugging interface over mcu_tracer

12. Aug 2016: Added
+Si8900 manual interface constructed
++Si8900 Sync for autobaudrate detection
++Si8900 readout routine
%Wished: Implement routine with DMA to save processor time.
++Improved routine for Si8900 with DMA implemented..
!!SI8900 is quite slow on readout. Choose alternative?


9. Aug 2016: Added overvoltage protected.
+Filtering added for over voltage protection
+ADC still noisy. Need to work on that.
